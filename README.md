This is a basic weather application.

After running the program, it will prompt you to type in a city, the city you want the weather and temperature of. Once you type in the city and click enter, 
the current temperature in Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit will be displayed, as well as the weather data.

Uses OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch data.

This project helped teach me how to incorporate APIs in Python.
